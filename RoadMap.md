# Roadmap

There are many ideas suggested, this is simply a personal long term project.

## Architecture

* The base is the data dictionary, i need to put more features to continuosly improve a generic eda process based in the dictionary

* Eventually move the munging tools to this project

* The generic EDA subproject is based in sns and 3Djs

## Milestones

#### Short term

1. Create a Data Dictionay to help in the Dataset understaning stage
2. Help to normalize characters in dataset:
        * Columns and text values with munging tools (spaces, ascii127, etc)
3. Short Help: function tables printing markdown
4. Start the DOCS
5. Configure stages for EDA graphs with sns and data dictionary

#### Medium term

1. Join the 3Djs library in standard way, meaby via display
2. Enable multiprocessing and speed via vectorization functions
1. be capable to make little dynamcal visual explorations enbling pure js

#### Long term

1. *A library able to be **the backbone** of an initial and small data process*
